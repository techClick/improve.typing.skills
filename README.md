## Deployment is new
They just added the requirement to deploy.
```
Everything works on vscode but the deployed site has an issue: 
javascripts canceltimeout is not working on netlify.
i.e. The challenge timer does not stop when it hits 0 secs or when you hit 'submit'.
I'm checking the issue to fix now. hopefully I will have time to fix it before revision
```
## Deployment
The site is deployed on [https://resilient-gumption-9bc18f.netlify.app](https://resilient-gumption-9bc18f.netlify.app).
```
Deployment steps.

I use CI/CD on Netlify.
Step 1: Link Netlify to this GitHub repository
Step 2: Accept deploy settings on Netlify(Netlify builds and sets up Next.js settings automatically)
Site is now deployed.
```
## Tools

React + Next.js + TypeScript + Styled components + Jest + React Testing Library
